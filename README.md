# Entity-Icons

Entity-Icons is a resource for Minecraft creators, including modders, resource pack creators, datapack creators, and plugin developers. It provides a collection of icons for all 1.19 mobs in Minecraft, categorized by resolution. Note that experimental mobs are not included.

#### Extras:
There is an additional directory at the resolution of 800x800, this does not have a sprite sheet, and was created mostly for when I needed a random one-off texture.

### Roadmap:
In the future, we plan to add the following to Entity-Icons:

- [ ] Villager types, either a sprite page for them, or just textures you can overlay yourself
- [ ] Zombie villager types, either a sprite page for them, or just textures you can overlay yourself
- [ ] Horse type overlays
- [ ] Fish type overlays
